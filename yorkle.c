   - If none of the matches above are correct, `result[i] is set to

   LR_WRONG_PLACE may only be used if the corresponding letter in the
   answer must not have been matched with another letter in the guess.

   Example: if the answer is `bread` and the guess is `erase`, index 1

   and A are in the answer), index 3 gets LR_INCORRECT (there is no S)

   LR_WRONG_PLACE in index 1 (there is another unmatched O in the
